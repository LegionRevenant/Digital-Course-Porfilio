            <p>This was a responsive application project that involved both SQL Server and C++. 
            The core application would be developed using C++ while maintaining efficiency using SQL Server for the data. 
            In the process, I learned to implement responsive design principles within the logic of the application and its database interactions. 
            Furthermore, I learned how to integrate this C++ application with SQL Server for proper data processing without any performance issues.

            <p>I created a responsive desktop application using HTML and CSS. 
                My focus was on the development of a layout that should appear both clean and structured yet works well for different screen sizes with smooth fluid transitions. 
                Learning key responsive design principles, I learned about flexible layouts and media queries, which ensured that it would work best for any number of desktop resolutions. 
                Techniques were also explored that enhanced usability and appeal, making the application functional.</p>
